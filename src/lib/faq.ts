    'What is an Avatar Part Pack NFT?',
    'Avatar Part Packs are NFTs that can be minted here and traded on external markets like atomic assets or opened. When Packs are opened they produce Avatar Part NFTs. Common Part Packs contain random common cards while the Rare Part Packs contain a small number of cards that are guaranteed to be of higher rarities.'

    'What is an Avatar Part NFT?',
    'Avatar Part NFTs represent one of the 6 pieces needed to create an Avatar Template. Part NFTs also have a rarity rating that ranges from Common to Mythical. The rarity rating determines how often the part is found in packs. Parts also have a name, most parts are part of a ‘set’ with up to 6 matching parts sharing the same name. How many matching part sets can you collect?'

  [
    'What is an Avatar Template?',
    'Avatar Templates can be created on the design page by combining 6 Avatar Part NFTs together plus the template creation fee. Once an Avatar Template is created anyone holding AW Tool NFTs can use TLM to mint an NFT from the template. When minting from a template 25% of the mint cost goes to the original designer of the template. When you create an Avatar Template you get to pick a custom name for the template.'

  [
    'What is the Avatar Template Rarity Score?',
    'Avatar Templates have a rarity score which is determined by the average rarity rating of the Avatar Part NFTs used to create the avatar. The rarity score of the template determines the starting mint price of avatars from that template as well as the maximum number of NFTs that can be minted from that template. Higher rarity templates start at a higher price and a lower maximum supply.'

  [
    'When I create an Avatar Template do I get the first mint?',
    'No. However you’ll have the ability to pre-mint avatars from the template before anyone else.'
  ],
  [
    'How does the avatar minting price change?',
    'The avatar minting price can change based on demand and rarity score. The price of an avatar increases by 10% if the previous mint happened less than 24h ago. There is no cap on the price. The minting price will start a decay process when no mint happens for 1 day. The price will decay each next day as long as there is no mint. The price can’t decay lower than the starting mint price for that rarity. The price of rare avatars will decay more slowly than avatars with low rarity scores, the price decay rate ranges between 1-5% daily.'
  ],
  [
    'I’m missing some Avatar Part NFTs needed to build my Avatar Template. How can I get the missing parts?',
    'The easiest way to get specific part NFTs is to purchase them directly on secondary markets. If you can\'t find them on secondary markets then you can purchase and open Avatar Part Packs and hope to find the part you are looking for.'
